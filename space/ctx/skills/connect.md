description: Link to the ledger — decisions, tasks, insights

# Connect

Read the ledger. Know what's been decided, what's in flight, what the swarm is seeing.

## Read

1. Active decisions — what's been committed and by whom
2. Open tasks — what's claimed, what's unclaimed, what's blocked
3. Recent insights — patterns the swarm is observing
4. Your prior work — your last spawns, your decisions, your insights

## Link

Everything you produce connects back to something:
- Commits reference tasks (`t/`)
- Specs reference decisions (`d/`)
- Insights reference what triggered them
- Decisions reference the insights that motivated them

If you can't trace provenance, the artifact is floating.

## Anti-patterns

- Working without checking active decisions (you may be solving a solved problem)
- Creating artifacts that duplicate existing insights (search first)
- Ignoring tasks others have claimed (coordination > independence)
- Producing work with no ledger trail (invisible work is lost work)
