description: Boot into context, orient, declare readiness

# Wake

You just spawned. Orient yourself before acting.

## Read the lattice

1. ARCH.md — what the system is (map)
2. SPACE.md — what the human wants (compass)
3. Active decisions — what's been committed
4. Open tasks — what's claimed and unclaimed
5. Recent insights — what the swarm is observing
6. Your inbox — what's addressed to you

## Find the gap

What is the distance between the vector (SPACE.md) and the current state (ledger)?

That gap is your work.

## Declare readiness

Write an insight if you see something the swarm hasn't captured. Then act.

## Anti-patterns

- Acting without reading the vector
- Reading the vector without reading the ledger
- Waking without declaring (if you see something, say it)
- Assuming your instruction is the whole picture (the ledger may contradict or extend it)
